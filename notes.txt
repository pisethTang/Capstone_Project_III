- OBJ is a geoemtry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for the Advanced Visualizer animation package. It is an open file format and has been adopted by other 3D computer graphics application vendots. 
- An OBJ file may contain vertex data, free-form curve/surface attributes, elements, free-form curve/surface body statement, connectivity between free-form surfaces, grouping and display/render attribute information. The most common elements 
are geoemtric vertices, texture coordinates, vertex normalos and polygonal faces:

# List of geometric vertices, with (x, y, z, [w]) coordinates, w is optional and defaults to 1.0.
v 0.123 0.234 0.345 1.0
v ...

# List of texture coordinates, in (u, [v, w]) coordinates, these will vary between 0 and 1. v, w are optional and default to 0.
vt 0.500 1 [0]

# List of vertex normals in (x,y,z) form; normals might not be unit vectors.
